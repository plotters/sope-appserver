Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.11.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

Changes in version `1.11.0'
===========================

NOTE: The libobjc library is now linked in with the base library and
NOT with individual applications or tools (except on MingW). This
requires that you do a complete rebuild of all libraries, tools and
apps when switching to this new version.

   * New rules for building and using DLLs were implemented. Now gcc
     and other tricks are used to properly export symbols, so no .def
     file should be needed.

   * The GNUsteprc file in $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT is deprecated. See the
     new GNUstep.conf file (which is not installed by default).

   * Psuedo-framwork support was implemented on MingW. This essentially
     involves copying the framework to several places so it can be used
     without links, which Windows does not really support.  There's no
     other clean way to do it.

   * Support for xxx_WINDRES_FILES on MinGW was implemented.
